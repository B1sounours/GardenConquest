[h1]Garden Conquest[/h1]

[b]Garden Conquest[/b] is a new, open source, Conquest-type mod for Space Engineers that  introduces new area control dynamics to combat-focused survival servers.

[b][u]IMPORTANT: THIS IS IN EARLY ALPHA. Things will break and change dramatically. Don't play with this mod right now unless you're helping the developers test it.[/u][/b]

[b]The core concepts are:[/b]

[b] [u]Ship Licences[/u] [/b] - a new building component
[b] [u]Hull Classifiers [/u][/b] - a new block for all ships and stations
[b] [u]Control Points [/u][/b] - receive Ship Licenses every 15 minutes by having the biggest navy in the control radius
[b][u] Ship Classes[/u] [/b] - spend Ship Licenses to build Hull Classifiers on your ships and stations, allowing them to become bigger, more complex, and specialized in different areas:

[h1] Ship Licenses [/h1]

These can only be obtained by holding a Control Point at the end of a 15-minute period, or by trading/stealing them with/from other players. They are the main functional component of Hull Classifiers.


[h1] Hull Classifiers [/h1]

These are new blocks that each correspond to one of the classes below. They must be built and powered to designate your ship as belonging to that class.

Every Ship/Station must be classified, even the "Unlicensed" ones. Unlicensed classifiers do not require Ship Licenses to build, but they have relatively low block limits.

If a ship goes unclassified for 2 hours, it will become a [b]Derelict[/b] and slowly deteriorate until it either is reclassified by a player or disappears entirely.


[h1] Control Points [/h1]

There are several Control Points on the map, each designated in advance by the server owner.

In order to win a 15 minute round, you or your faction must have the [b]most ships in that area at the time that[/b]:

* have a powered, broadcasting Hull Classifier beacon
* have a broadcast range on the classifier at least as large the ship's distance to the CP. This is to prevent players from hiding while capturing a CP. If someone stands in the center of a CP, they will see broadcasts from every Conquesting ship.

Bigger ships count more towards your total. In the event of a tie, no one wins.

The winner of a round will receive the Licenses directly into the first open inventory in their largest ship. If they have no open inventory, they won't receive the Licenses.


[h1] Classes (subject to significant change): [/h1]
